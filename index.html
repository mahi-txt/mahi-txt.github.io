      <p>Last night, I spent an hour and a half transporting myself to a more significant city. Sunday night. Why am I here? About 7 living people I saw while in said city for 45 minutes. 5 of which were also American university students. Why are we here? 2 of which were locking doors to their respective art gallery and convenience store. Quietest place I've experienced in a very long time. Standing between a cathedral and a pharmacy. Silent, I am the loudest thing around. I am a headless chicken. I spent an hour returning to the airport hotel room in which a monkey hanging from a rope awaited me. A light fixture. The loneliest I've felt in a while was 11 pm on a summer Sunday in the center of Munich. I said to someone later that night that I would film a movie here.</p>
