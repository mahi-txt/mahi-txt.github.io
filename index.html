      <p>Last night, I spent an hour and a half transporting myself to a more significant city. Sunday night. Why am I here? About 7 living people I saw while in said city for 45 minutes. 5 of which were also American university students. Why are we here? 2 of which were locking doors to their respective art gallery and convenience store. Quietest place I've experienced in a very long time. Standing between a cathedral and a pharmacy. Silent, I am the loudest thing around. I am a headless chicken. I spent an hour returning to the airport hotel room in which a monkey hanging from a rope awaited me. A light fixture. The loneliest I've felt in a while was 11 pm on a summer Sunday in the center of Munich. I said to someone later that night that I would film a movie here.</p>

      <p>There is a plate of food in front of me with interesting colors. The smell is promising. Listening to Here I Go Again (1987), Whitesnake, Warner Music. Lots of Warner Music on this seat back. Half glass of some German white wine and untouched glass of sparkling water that becomes more akin to its still brothers and sisters for every minute I spend writing. How many things am I letting go without realizing it? I may know what it means to love someone.</p>

      <p>We (me and someone or a collection of people I am in awe of - how do you do it? you took your life and made it the most beautiful thing I’ve seen) are old. On a street-facing patio somewhere. No one expects anything. The sun is out (or isn’t) and the air feels clean and light (this is required). So you know it was a place that’s hard to get to and easy to find (I love you).</p>

      <p>No worries, I'll do my job. This is so I can have time off of my job. Every meal I’ve had will be the best meal I’ll ever have. If I never kiss you again, I’ll look upon this fondly.</p>

      <p>Some moments feel transitory and sometimes I ascribe their beauty to the fact that they must end. Suffering, though, isn’t defined by my belief in its end. I give it power to consume all, to give me a silent permission to abdicate responsibility, rhyme, and reason. I give it more of my space and time in hopes that if we let it grow, it will go away. I let it grow but I am no longer shocked, moved, or surprised by it. It happens and it’s a piece of me. <br>I suffer, I give it time, I heal for the rest of my life. I love, I run away from it, I regret it for the rest of my life. I look back and think it was beautiful and will I find it again?

<br>Suffering is the tree that keeps growing right under me and beauty is the fleeting bird I am raised closer to. I carry the hope that we belong to the same branch.

      <p>I will note the way you breathe and the way your back curves quietly into your hips. I will note the route blood travels from your shoulders to your hands and the way your teeth wage war on themselves when you sleep.  I will note the way longing slips into your eyes and the way gentleness finds your voice. When you aren’t here, I will note you.</p>
