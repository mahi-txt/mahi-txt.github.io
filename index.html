      <p>a young woman (21) awakens from a disquieting dream, the sole resident of a nap birthed of necessity and nostalgia and its illicit affair with an alarming novel (translated from danish). she wants a coke.<br>
<br>


on the way to answers, the young woman passes a third space (boys fishing in the golf course lake) where today, one boy has actually caught a fish. “i caught a fish!” he says to the young woman. it appears he has caught a fish. america has third spaces.<br>
<br>


the young woman approaches the golf course ice machine with an unencumbered sense of hope. if she can’t feasibly discover a coke, she could treat herself to a cup of ice, and this thought fills her with joy. it is with mirthful and naive eyes that she reads the machine is Out of Order. america has third spaces but they failed her and her great expectations today.<br>

      <p>Last night, I spent an hour and a half transporting myself to a more significant city. Sunday night. Why am I here? About 7 living people I saw while in said city for 45 minutes. 5 of which were also American university students. Why are we here? 2 of which were locking doors to their respective art gallery and convenience store. Quietest place I've experienced in a very long time. Standing between a cathedral and a pharmacy. Silent, I am the loudest thing around. I am a headless chicken. I spent an hour returning to the airport hotel room in which a monkey hanging from a rope awaited me. A light fixture. The loneliest I've felt in a while was 11 pm on a summer Sunday in the center of Munich. I said to someone later that night that I would film a movie here.</p>

      <p>There is a plate of food in front of me with interesting colors. The smell is promising. Listening to Here I Go Again (1987), Whitesnake, Warner Music. Lots of Warner Music on this seat back. Half glass of some German white wine and untouched glass of sparkling water that becomes more akin to its still brothers and sisters for every minute I spend writing. How many things am I letting go without realizing it? I may know what it means to love someone.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Some moments feel transitory and sometimes I ascribe their beauty to the fact that they must end. Suffering, though, isn’t defined by my belief in its end. I give it power to consume all, to give me a silent permission to abdicate responsibility, rhyme, and reason. I give it more of my space and time in hopes that if we let it grow, it will go away. I let it grow but I am no longer shocked, moved, or surprised by it. It happens and it’s a piece of me. <br>I suffer, I give it time, I heal for the rest of my life. I love, I run away from it, I regret it for the rest of my life. I look back and think it was beautiful and will I find it again?

<br>Suffering is the tree that keeps growing right under me and beauty is the fleeting bird I am raised closer to. I carry the hope that we belong to the same branch.

      <p>I will note the way you breathe and the way your back curves quietly into your hips. I will note the route blood travels from your shoulders to your hands and the way your teeth wage war on themselves when you sleep.  I will note the way longing slips into your eyes and the way gentleness finds your voice. When you aren’t here, I will note you.</p>

      <p>Always in transit lately. My body makes a home out of cramped seats and soft hotel pillows that forget my shape by morning. The world unfolds under me. sky, train tracks, unfamiliar ceilings. flung around<br>
<br>
<br>Sometimes I forget what it feels like to be known in the quiet. To be someone's evening routine. To fall asleep pressed into another body and feel the ache in your chest settle because you’ve finally landed somewhere<br>
<br>
<br>I remember though. I have left roots behind in people. There are those who carry versions of me like pressed flowers between pages. I find myself again in their laughter, our silence, the volume of our love<br>
<br>
<br>I am still tethered, softly.</p>

  <div class="title">monolithic beauty</div>
    <div class="timestamp">Posted on 2024-06-27 at 2:49 PM</div>

      <p>
writing at work. in new york (not monroe, louisiana, for those of you i complained to)<br>
the power of this city is not lost on me.<br>
i spent the early years of my life here, not understanding who i was or where i was<br>
i don’t know if i do now, but it feels different<br>
less like being lost, more like being small in a place that understands smallness is not a weakness.<br>
<br>
<br>cultural monolith?<br>
what does that mean and why can’t i get it out of my head?<br>
monolith implies unwavering-ness. unpenetrability. indivisible and uniform<br>
but the city feels like all of that and the opposite. fractured and loud and endlessly reinventing itself,<br>
still somehow, undeniably one thing.<br>
maybe that’s the monolith. not in the cold, stone way. more like something ancient and alive<br>
maybe that’s what all the sitcoms were trying to bottle<br>
this place has a mythology. a gravitational pull.<br>
it’s bizarre to be here and not be fictional<br>
i walk past buildings and remember shows i watch when i feel alone<br>
i walk into restaurants that feel like movie sets<br>
sometimes it’s like i’m trespassing inside someone else’s dream<br>
sometimes it’s like i’ve finally been let into mine.<br>
<br>
<br>what made it so expensive here?<br>
i’m young and texan and removed but nostalgic for an era i never really lived through<br>
when a slice was a dollar and if you had anything to do between the hours of 8 and 6,<br>
you were free to just be after that<br>
dinner, drinks, hobbies, a cool apartment with fun trinkets because that was who you are.<br>
not because you abandoned everyone and everything and yourself<br>
<br>
<br>i’m disillusioned<br>
i’m used to paying the same for a drink as a pizza and a t-shirt (twenty dollars)<br>
i’m used to feeling unlovable, like being loudly in love with someone is an act of trespass<br>
and in a city that preaches unapologetic truth and being,<br>
being loud about that in a place where your weight and being is welcome<br>
because a monolith will not break,<br>
a cultural monolith is not threatened by your propensities or your self-importance.<br>
if it’s not a way to explore love, from any angle, it’s noise.<br>
<br>
<br>i’m a small monolith.
i’m overwhelmed by my capacity to love and to be loved.<br>
food. food is so good.<br>
i agree with what you said last night. we should build photo booths around here.
we haven't engaged in enough high initial investment, high margin business ventures,
indulge in nostalgia. you don't know who you are, but you're beautiful, perceptive, and let's do it<br>
<br>
<br>cool. i should probably return to my work<br>
i told my coworker i’m working on another task and she said no worries, there’s no rush.<br>
thanks.<br>
i’m not the best employee but i’m great at being me.<br>
self-indulgence, maybe they need that.<br>
they probably don’t<br>
<br>
<br>another thing i did today was make three new playlists.<br>
found some new artists<br>
i pinged my friends to say music as a product boasts portfolio diversity like no other and i am finding so much joy in doing granular deep dives to create collections for hyper-specific use cases<br>
i miss them!<br>
i’m finding joy in deep dives<br>
granular collections for hyper-specific use cases<br>
commutes. walks with no purpose<br>
grief. light rain that doesn’t make you open an umbrella<br>
a hunger that’s spiritual and physical (i just like food)<br>
<br>
<br>there are so many types of elevators<br>
workspaces, retail areas, clubs, restaurants.<br>
so many different textures of heartbreak and intimacy<br>
longing, drive, beauty that doesn’t need to be explained.<br>
i want to capture it all, i'm ravenous<br>
i feel deep and whole and completely alone.<br>
<br>
<br>i miss you, i do<br>
and maybe that’s part of it too.<br>
being in this city makes everything feel cinematic,<br>
so when i miss you, it’s not quiet<br>
it echoes off buildings. it leaks into streetlight reflections.<br>
your absence turns into a shape that fits right into the skyline<br>
like i could point to it, like a landmark.<br>
<br>
<br>i want to talk to you.<br>
you keep me up at night and haunt my dreams<br>
i want to learn how i hurt you and how i can fix it<br>
but you don’t owe me anything<br>
your self-respect does not need to involve mine<br>
<br>
<br>still, i wish i felt like i could’ve told you that i love you.<br>
i still want you to know i did.<br>
is that bad?<br>
me, another girl that creeped into love with you and thinks about monoliths and light fixtures and was as impossible as we all anticipated<br>
can i say thank you to the people that didn't make you feel alone like i did<br>
<br>
<br>maybe love is also a kind of monolith<br>
not cold. not impassable.<br>
just something too large to explain.<br>
something that doesn’t move for anyone,<br>
but still, somehow, makes space for everything<br>
<br>
<br> check out call soon. what did you do today mahi? manager manager i wrote some stuff. i'm love with life, mananger (no one calls anyone manager) (communication is performative)<br>
